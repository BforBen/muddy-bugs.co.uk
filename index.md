# Welcome

Muddy bugs are happy to run sessions on a freelance basis in schools, nurseries or with home education and child minding groups.

I have experience of working with children from 2 - 16 years old at Forest School but have worked with children from birth - 18 years old within my career.

I have also completed a certificate in adult education and have run many sessions for teachers and support staff to introduce them to the Forest School approach, getting them to experience what the children do.

If any of these areas interest you, please do get in touch and we can discuss your requirements, tailoring everything to your needs.
