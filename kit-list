Please find below a list of kit that we ask children who attend Forest School sessions to bring. Please note, we aim to run sessions whatever the weather so we look to strongly enforce the clothing requirements. At Muddy Bugs we strongly believe in the saying

'There is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.'

Winter

Wellington boots or walking boots
Thick socks or 2 pairs of "normal" socks
Leggings or tights under trousers
Trousers (not jeans)
Vest or thermals
Long sleeved t-shirt
Jumper or fleece (we ask for two of these just in case)
Waterproofs (separates or an all in one), salopettes and jacket or ski suit
Hat, scarf and gloves
Summer

Wellington boots, walking boots or trainers
Socks
Long sleeved t-shirt
Jumper or fleece (it can get cold in the woods even in Summer)
Trousers (not jeans)
If it looks like rain, full waterproofs so we can go out whatever the weather
If there is a chance of sun, a sun hat and sun cream
