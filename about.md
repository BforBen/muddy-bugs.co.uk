Hi, my name is Ali and I am a freelance Level 3 Forest School Leader and I work under the name Muddy Bugs . I have worked in childcare since 1999. I have a first class BA honours degree in Early Years Childcare and Education. Alongside these I hold a current paediatric first aid certificate and have an enhanced CRB check.

I was inspired to complete my Forest School training after hearing about it at university, I started to research it and became hooked on the idea of inspiring children to enjoy the outdoors. With this inspiration I completed a dissertation on Forest School and then began my Forest School training. I have visited a number of established Forest Schools working with children from 4 months to 15 years, witnessing how it works with the different age groups.

I complete my level 3 training in early 2011 and now want to facilitate as many children as possible and give them access to Forest School.
