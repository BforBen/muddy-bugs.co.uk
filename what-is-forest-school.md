Forest School was originally introduced to England in 1994 having originated in Denmark and other Scandinavian countries. It focuses on getting the children outside into the natural environment and giving them the freedom to learn and develop freely, making their own decisions about how and what they do. The philosophy of Forest Schools is to encourage and inspire individuals of any age through positive outdoor experiences. By participating in engaging, motivating and achievable tasks and activities in a woodland environment, each participant has an opportunity to develop intrinsic motivation, sound emotion and social skills. These, through self-awareness, can be developed so the children can reach their personal potential. Forest Schools have demonstrated success with children of all ages who visit the same local woodlands on a regular basis and, through play, have the opportunity to learn about the natural environment, how to handle risks and most importantly to use their own initiative to solve problems and co-operate with others. Children use full sized tools, play, learn boundaries of behaviour, both physical and social, establish and grow in confidence, self-esteem and become self-motivated.
